Products are always associated with a store. Think of them as items on the shelves of your digital shop. Each product can be one of several types, each serving a different purpose. Let's break them down:

| Product Type  | Availability         | Description           | Example Use Case                  |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| One Time      | General Availability | Single purchase items | Lifetime access to a software     |
| Service       | General Availability | Sellable services     | Consulting or design work         |
| Downloads     | Beta                 | Downloadable files    | Screen recording software         |
| Serial Keys   | General Availability | Unique access codes   | Discord bot access key            |
| License       | Planned (Q1 2025)    | Software licenses     | App licenses managed via API      |
| Subscriptions | Planned (Q4 2024)    | Recurring payments    | Monthly access to a service       |
| Physical      | Planned (Q4 2056)    | Tangible products     | T-shirts or merchandise (US only) |

## Regional Pricing (Coming Soon)

We're excited to announce that regional pricing will be available in the near future (planned for Q2 2025). This feature will allow you to set different prices for different regions, making your products more accessible to a global audience. This will be an optional feature and it's togglable.

Once implemented, you'll be able to set prices for specific regions. For example:

- A customer in the US might see a price of `$5.00` `USD`
- A customer in Germany might see a price of `€3.00` `EUR`
- A customer in Bangladesh might see a price of `৳100.00` `BDT`

This feature will help you optimize your pricing strategy for different markets and potentially increase your global sales.
