A chargeback occurs when a customer disputes a transaction with their bank.

To start a chargeback, a customers bank files a dispute with the payment network, which quickly reverses the payment. This means the payment amount and any related fees are taken from Pandabase. After that, Pandabase will deduct the total amount (the payment plus the fee) from your account.
