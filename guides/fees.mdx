We always strive to keep our fees as low as possible, but this isn't always feasible due to various factors.

## Fee Structure

Here are the current rates:

| **Service**                  | **Fees**                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Payment Processing**       | 6% + $0.50 per successful payment                      |
| **Tax Calculation**          | 0.5% + $0.10 per successful tax remit                  |
| **Radar (Fraud Protection)** | $0.10 per successful payment                           |
| **Subscription**             | 1% of the subscription amount + payment processing fee |
| **Invoicing**                | $0.10 per successful paid invoice                      |
| **Dispute**                  | $20.00 per dispute                                     |
| **Early Dispute Alerts**     | $25.00 per alert                                       |

### How does it work?

We've prepared various examples to help you easily understand our fees, which are actually quite low. The **Payment Processing** fee covers everything, including currency conversion and international payment processing, totaling **6% + $0.50** per successful payment. We do not charge anything beyond that.

If you enable our **Merchant of Record services**, there will be an additional fee of **0.5% + $0.10** per successful payment.

Therefore, if you combine the **Payment Processing** and **Tax Calculation** services, the total charge will be **6.5% + $0.60** per payment processed.

### Payment Scenario

Let's say a customer in Germany purchases a digital product priced at `$20.00` `USD` from your shop.

Given the VAT rate of `20%`, the total charged will be `$24.00` USD.

Since the customer is using euros, this would convert to approximately `€22.22` `EUR` at the current exchange rate.

Once the customer makes the payment, we will remit `$4.00` USD (`20% VAT`) to the German government.

Next, we will charge you our service fee of **`6.5% + $0.60`** on the product's base price. This means you'll incur fees of about `$1.90 USD` in fees.

- **Recap**
  - **Total Charged**: `$24.00 USD` (includes VAT).
  - **Conversion**: Approximately `€22.22 EUR` for the customer.
  - **VAT Remittance**: We will remit `$4.00 USD` to the German government.
  - **Service Fees**: Total fee is `6.5% + $0.60`, resulting in about `$1.90 USD` in fees.
  - **Net Profit**: After fees, your profit is `$18.10 USD`. If you enable Radar, your profit will be `$18.00 USD`.

### Invoicing Scenario

We will charge an additional **$0.10 USD** per successful invoice, alongside the payment fee.

For example, for a **100.00 USD** invoice with taxes and Radar enabled for a customer in California (where the tax rate is **20%**), the total charged will be **120.00 USD** (100.00 + 20.00 tax). We will remit the **$20.00 USD** tax to the California state.

Next, we will charge you:

- **6.5%** of the invoice amount **$6.50**
- **$0.60** for payment processing
- **$0.10** for Radar
- **$0.10** for invoicing

In total, the fees will be:

- **6.50 + 0.60 + 0.10 + 0.10 = $7.30 USD**.

After all fees, you will be left with **120.00 - 7.30 = $92.70 USD**.

### Subscription Scenario

<Accordion title="What happens if I lose a dispute?">
  If you lose a dispute, we will deduct the payment amount along with the
  associated fees. For example, if the dispute amount was **`$24.00 USD`**
  (including taxes) and the fees totaled **`$1.90 USD`**, we will deduct
  **`$25.90 USD`** from your balance. You must keep your dispute rates at an
  optimal level otherwise we will restrict your shop.
