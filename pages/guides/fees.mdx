# Fees

The fee structure of Pandabase is diffrent from other platforms.

Here's a picture that pretty much explains everything about our fee structure.

### Overview

There are two types of fees: one is called a **Platform Fee**, and the other one
is called a **Processing Fee**. The Platform Fee is collected by Pandabase from
you on every purchase, and on the base plan, it's just 4.5% + 50 cents per
successful order or transaction. On the other hand, Processing fees are paid by
the customer who is buying your product and sit at exactly 1.5% per transaction.
You do not have to pay this fee.

For example, if you create a product priced at $10.00, we'll show the customer
at checkout that with Processing fees it's $10.15, and your customer will pay
the $10.15. It will appear in their bank statement as
**`"PANDABASE (SHOP.HANDLE)"`**. Your customer gets charged $10.15. Then we'll
cut the platform fee from you, which is 4.5% plus an additional 50 cents. That
counts up to $0.95 in fees. After all the processing and fees, you will receive
exactly $9.05. We have included the fee for payment processing in this 4.5% + 50
cents (Currency conversion is also included, and your balance is automatically
settled to USD).

### Stripe Connect

By enabling the Stripe Connect integration, we will no longer be a Merchant of
Record (MoR). This means you'll handle disputes, taxes, and fraud.

With Stripe Connect, expect a fixed fee of 3% from us, separate from Stripe's
processing fees. Stripe will deposit Card/CashApp payments directly into your
bank account. However, it's important to note that we'll still handle
transferring earnings from PayPal and Crypto sales to your bank account that you
provided us. Stripe won't handle these payouts for you.
