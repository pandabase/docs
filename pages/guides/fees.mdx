# Fees

The fee structure of Pandabase is diffrent from other platforms.

Here's a picture that pretty much explains everything about our fee structure.

![Detailed Fees](/assets/fees-detailed.png)

### Overview

There are two types of fees: one is called a **Platform Fee**, and the other one
is called a **Processing Fee**. The Platform Fee is collected by Pandabase from
you on every purchase, and on the base plan, it's just 4.5% + 50 cents per
successful order or transaction. On the other hand, Processing fees are paid by
the customer who is buying your product and sit at exactly 1.5% per transaction.
You do not have to pay this fee.

For example, if you create a product priced at $10.00, we'll show the customer
at checkout that with Processing fees it's $10.15, and your customer will pay
the $10.15. It will appear in their bank statement as
**`"PANDABASE.IO (SHOP.HANDLE)"`**. Your customer gets charged $10.15. Then
we'll cut the platform fee from you, which is 4.5% plus an additional 50 cents.
That counts up to $0.95 in fees. After all the processing and fees, you will
receive exactly $9.05. We have included the fee for payment processing in this
4.5% + 50 cents (Currency conversion is also included, and your balance is
automatically settled to USD).

### Stripe Connect

If you decide to use our Stripe Connect integration, we will no longer act as a
MoR (Merchant of Record), and you will be responsible for disputes and other
matters, including fraud.

If you decide to use **Stripe Connect**, you will be charged exactly 3%
excluding the payment processing fees of Stripe. Stripe will payout directly to
your bank account instead of us. However, we'll continue to pay out the amount
you make from PayPal and Crypto sales to your bank account on our behalf.
