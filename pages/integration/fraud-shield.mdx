# Fraud Shield Overview

Fraud Shield ("Signals") provides an extra level of protection for your shops.
While Pandabase Chargeback Protection isn't provided free of charge, Pandabase
Fraud Shield ("Signals") is offered for free to all users. Fraud Shield helps
you fight disputes that are not legitimate.

### Enabling

Fraud Shield is enabled by default for all shops free of charge. Fraud Shield
blocks 85% of fraudulent payments and detects suspicious cards that appear
illegitimate to us. By default, we do not accept any high-risk payments and
automatically decline them. However, if you wish to accept high-risk payments,
please upgrade your shop to the "Pro" plan and disable Fraud Shield.

### Supported Payment Methods

Pandabase Fraud Shield currently only covers card payments. We are looking
forward to expanding to other providers.

### Chargeback Protection

Pandabase offers a Chargeback Protection program for merchants with a good
history of processing payments with us. To be considered eligible, the shop must
have processed $30,000 in gross volume over a period of 6 months, and dispute
rates must remain under 0.70%. Once dispute protection is turned on, it will
incur an additional charge of 30 cents per transaction if the transaction amount
is under $10. However, if the transaction amount is more than $10, we will
charge 0.5% per transaction.

### How does it work

Pandabase uses advanced machine learning to detect fraud on our network. With
extensive data, including customer behavior patterns, IP reputation analysis,
and additional factors, we are equipped to proactively mitigate fraudulent
disputes. With this information, we can effectively block up to 85% of
fraudulent disputes.
