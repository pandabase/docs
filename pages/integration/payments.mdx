# Payments Overview

There are two distinct payment session types offered by Pandabase. The first,
known as **"Overlay Checkouts"**, presents a seamless integration solution that
circumvents the necessity for a dedicated storefront. This feature enables you
to embed checkout models securely onto your website, facilitating the acceptance
of various payment methods including Paypal, credit/debit cards, and
cryptocurrencies.

The second type, referred to as **"Checkout Sessions"**, operates through our
secure `checkout.pandabase.io` subdomain. Here, customers can securely conduct
their transactions. It's important to note that both implementations adhere to
the highest security standards and are fully compliant with PCI-DSS regulations.

## Checkout Sessions

<Callout type='info' emoji='ℹ️'>
  Checkout sessions is also used in Pandabase storefronts.
</Callout>

Checkout sessions is the simplest method to facilitate payments on your
Pandabase Shop. By invoking a POST request to
`/v2/shops/<YOUR_SHOP_ID>/payments` with the necessary parameters and `type` of
`checkout_session`, you'll receive back a `checkout_url` in the response.
Simply, redirect your customers to this URL to complete their payment securely.

Here's an example of checkout sessions invoked with the cURL command.

```sh copy
curl -X POST \
  https://api.pandabase.io/v2/shops/shopId/payments \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Pandabase-Publishable-Key: pb_pk_...' \
  -d '{
    "coupon": "optional_coupon",
    "customer": {
        "name": "Customer Name",
        "email": "customer@example.com",
        "billing": {
            "line1": "123 Main Street",
            "line2": "Apt 1",
            "city": "City",
            "state": "State",
            "postal_code": "12345",
            "country": "Country"
        }
    },
    "line_items": [
        {
            "id": "pt_...",
            "quantity": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "pt_...",
            "quantity": 2
        }
    ],
    "type": "checkout_session"
}'
```

## Overlay Sessions

Overlay sessions are highly customizable UI components, currently only available
for React sites. However, we are working on developing a global JavaScript
package to ensure it works across various frameworks.

Overlay sessions enable payment acceptance within a modal embedded within your
site. This functionality obviates the need for customers to redirect to the
Pandabase Checkout page, ensuring a seamless payment experience. All payment
processes occur within your site.

To use overlay sessions, simply initiate a POST request to
`/v2/shops/<YOUR_SHOP_ID>/payments` with all the required parameters, specifying
the `type` as `overlay_session`. In response, you will receive secure
`payment_intent`, `payment_tokenizer`, and `payment_client_secret` values. These
are used in your application by `@pandabase/react-elements` package.

Here's an example.

```sh copy
curl -X POST \
  https://api.pandabase.io/v2/shops/shopId/payments \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Pandabase-Publishable-Key: pb_pk_...' \
  -d '{
    "coupon": "optional",
    "customer": {
        "name": "optional",
        "email": "optional@example.com",
        "billing": {
            "line1": "optional",
            "line2": "optional",
            "city": "optional",
            "state": "optional",
            "postal_code": "optional",
            "country": "optional"
        }
    },
    "line_items": [
        {
            "id": "pt_...",
            "quantity": 1
        },
        {
            "id": "pt_...",
            "quantity": 2
        }
    ],
    "type": "overlay_session"
}'
```

### React Usage

<Callout type='info' emoji='ℹ️'>
  You can enable dark mode by passing in `theme="dark"` prop to the
  `PaymentElement` component.
</Callout>

```ts copy
import React, { useState } from "react";
import PaymentElement from "@pandabase/react-elements";

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);

  const handleOpenModal = () => {
    setIsModalOpen(true);
  };

  const handleCloseModal = () => {
    setIsModalOpen(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
        <button
          onClick={handleOpenModal}
        >
          Checkout
        </button>

      <PaymentElement
        data={{
          customer: {
            email: "john@example.com",
          },
          line_items: [
            { id: "1", quantity: 2 },
            { id: "2", quantity: 2 },
          ],
          type: "overlay_session",
        }}
        isOpen={isModalOpen}
        onClose={handleCloseModal}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
