# Webhook Overview

Pandabase webhooks can be utilized to construct real-time systems and facilitate
payment acceptance. If you intend to provide something to a user immediately
after a purchase, you can leverage webhook events.

## Verification

For additional safety, it is essential to always verify webhooks.

Webhooks can be verified to ensure they were actually sent by Pandabase and not
by a malicious entity.

To verify a webhook, you will need your webhook secret or token to confirm the
SHA256 HMAC signature. Check the `X-Pandabase-Signature` header in the webhook
response headers.

Here is a TypeScript implementation:

```ts
import crypto from 'crypto'

const secret = 'wh_'
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', secret)
  .update(JSON.stringify(req.body))
  .digest('hex')

if (req.headers['X-Pandabase-Signature'] === signature) {
  console.log('Valid signature. The response was sent by Pandabase.')
} else {
  console.log(
    'Invalid signature. Deny the request as it may be from an unauthorized source.'
  )
}
```

This code calculates the HMAC signature by hashing the JSON string of the
webhook payload using the SHA256 algorithm and the provided secret. The result
is a hexadecimal digest.

If the calculated signature matches the value of `X-Pandabase-Signature`, then
the response is considered valid and was indeed sent by Pandabase itself.
Otherwise, the request should be denied as it may be from an unauthorized
source.
