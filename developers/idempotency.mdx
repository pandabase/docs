The API supports idempotent requests for `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` operations. An idempotent request can be retried multiple times without the risk of performing the same operation more than once.

## Idempotent requests

To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique key. If you don't receive a response due to a network connection error, you can retry the request with the same key to guarantee that it is only performed once.

## Generating idempotency keys

We recommend using `V4` UUIDs, or any other random string with enough randomness to avoid collisions. Keys can be up to `256` characters long.
