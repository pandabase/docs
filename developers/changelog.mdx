<Update label="December 25, 2025" description="Upcoming API Release" tags={["V3"]}>
## Breaking Changes

You cannot migrate from `V2` endpoints to V3 directly as it's a breaking change and we've rewritten our entire API from the ground up. It took us a year but it was well worth it for the future of our platform.

All endpoints from `api.pandabase.io/{v1}-{v2}` will be reachable until January 1st, 2026, after which we will fully deprecate the old endpoints.

## New Base URL

The new base URL is `pandabase.io/api`

## API Key Changes

For new V3 API keys, you no longer need to specify `/shops/{shopId}/<object-name>` as the `X-Storefront-Id` header automatically infers that if you use our SDKs.

We have also renamed shop objects to store objects.

**Example V3 API Key:**

```txt
sk_v3_vTUkUBKIDblpPUXKbTEmqIdgpngsvhvX
```

## Available Endpoints

The V3 API includes the following endpoints:

- `/payments`
- `/storefront`
- `/orders`
- `/coupons`
- `/products`
  - `/licenses` (only available if you use managed licenses)
- `/customers`

## Webhooks

Webhooks now have a new response format. Here's an example of what you can expect:

```json
{
  "id": "wh_",
  "type": "payment.succeeded",
  "data": {
    "id": "pmnt_",
    "amount": 1000,
    "status": "succeeded"
  }
}
```
