Pandabase HTTP API allows developers to interact programmatically with their
Pandabase resources using HTTP requests.

The API supports any programming language or framework that can send HTTP
requests.

You can use the commands listed below with `curl` by providing your token.

## API Basics

| Environment | URL                                | Protocols                 | Architecture |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| Production  | `https://api.pandabase.io`         | HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 over TLS | REST         |
| Sandbox     | `https://api.sandbox.pandabase.io` | HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 over TLS | REST         |

## Additional Information

- All endpoints are accessible under the specified URLs.
- The API follows the REST architecture principles.
- Both production and sandbox environments support HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols.
- All communications are secured using TLS (Transport Layer Security).

### Domains and IP addresses

<Warning>
  Only `HTTPS` requests are allowed, any requests made with `HTTP` will be
  redirected.
</Warning>

### Content Type

All requests must be encoded as JSON with the Content-Type: `application/json`
header. If not otherwise specified, responses from the Pandabase API, including
errors, are encoded exclusively as JSON as well.

### Authentication

API keys are necessary for authentication and API usage. Although
account session tokens can be used, they are not recommended due to security reasons.

```json
  Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
```

### Versioning

We include the current version information in the `Pandabase-Version` response header.
Our API versioning follows a date-based structure in the format of `YYYY/MM/DD`.

### Request IDs

Every API request you make is assigned a unique request identifier for easy
tracking and troubleshooting. This identifier can be found in the response
headers under `X-Request-Id`. In the rare event if you encounter an issue with
our service, providing this request identifier to our support team will expedite
the resolution process.
