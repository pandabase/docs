## Response Attributes

All API error responses follow this format and will remain consistent:

<ResponseField name="statusCode" type="number" required>
  The HTTP status code of the error
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="error" type="string" required>
  The status code description (e.g., `NOT_FOUND`)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string" required>
  A descriptive message explaining the error
</ResponseField>

Message fields is designed to not contain sensitive information, and can be
safely passed down to user interfaces.
