  We will assume you have a general understanding of programming. This guide is
  intended for developers, and we expect you to have a good understanding of
  REST APIs in general. If you're not a developer, please skip this section.

We'll make practical use of dynamic payments so that you can use them effectively in your applications. There are 8 steps to complete to make this work in a production environment. We will use TypeScript and Node.js here, but the implementation can be ported to any language.

A practical use case for dynamic payments is, for example, if you have a Discord server and you want to grant a user a role. In this case, you can pass in:

```
fields[{input: "discord_username", display_value: "Discord Username"}]
```

during the payment creation. This will prompt for the Discord username in the checkout process. Once the payment is made, a `payment.succeeded` webhook event is triggered. You can then receive the Discord username as `discord_username` or `fields[0].input` in the request body of the webhook and grant the user their role.

This has many practical applications, for example, a site selling dynamic courses or other customizable products or services.

<Step title="Grab the secrets">

Log in to your account and navigate to the "API Tokens" section. Click the "Create New Token" button. The generated API token will look similar to this: `api_tok_A7eUMjyjyMfV9G0u7YH18SozCpr1hEiU`. Copy and securely store the API token.

Next in your shop, create a new webhook. The webhook secret will look like this: `whsk_GseIBNijOmcUFeI3G5OEkgfus5ZfRMZ5`. Copy and securely store the webhook secret.

We are storing these two secrets as 
```env .env
PANDABASE_API_TOKEN="api_tok_A7eUMjyjyMfV9G0u7YH18SozCpr1hEiU"
PANDABASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsk_GseIBNijOmcUFeI3G5OEkgfus5ZfRMZ5"
```
in our `.env` file.
