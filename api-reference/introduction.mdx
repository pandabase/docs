Pandabase HTTP API allows developers to interact programmatically with their
Pandabase resources using HTTP requests.

The API supports any programming language or framework that can send HTTP
requests.

You can use the commands listed below with `curl` by providing your token.

## API Basics

Our API is exposed as an `HTTP/1.1` and `HTTP/`2 service over TLS. All endpoints live
under the URL `https://api.pandabase.io` and generally follow the REST
architecture.

### Domains and IP addresses

<Warning>
  Only HTTPs requests are allowed any request made with HTTP will be redirected.
</Warning>

### Content Type

All requests must be encoded as JSON with the Content-Type: `application/json`
header. If not otherwise specified, responses from the Pandabase API, including
errors, are encoded exclusively as JSON as well.

### Authentication

API keys are required to authenticate and use the API. Although
account session tokens can be used, they are not recommended due to security reasons.

```json
  Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
```

### Errors

All API endpoints follow a consistent format for error responses to ensure clear communication.

The error response structure consists of the following fields:

```json
{
  "statusCode": number,
  "message": string,
  "error": string
}
```

Message fields is designed to not contain sensitive information, and can be
safely passed down to user interfaces.

### Versioning

We include the current version information in the `API-Version` response header.
Our API versioning follows a date-based structure in the format of `YYYY/MM/DD`.

### Rate Limits

We limit the number of calls you can make over a certain period of time. Rate
limits vary and are specified by the following header in all responses:

| Header                  | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-Ratelimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make.       |
| `X-Ratelimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.           |
| `X-Ratelimit-Reset`     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |

### Request IDs

Every API request you make is assigned a unique request identifier for easy
tracking and troubleshooting. This identifier can be found in the response
headers under `X-Request-Id`. In the rare event if you encounter an issue with
our service, providing this request identifier to our support team will expedite
the resolution process.

### Idempotency

We use idempotency for safely retrying requests. When creating or updating an object, use an idempotency key. Then, if a connection error occurs, you can safely repeat the request without the risk of creating a second object or performing the update twice.

To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional `Idempotency-Key` header in the request.
We suggest using V4 UUIDs to generate idempotency keys as they need to be unique to avoid collisions. Keys can be up to 256 characters long.

The system automatically removes the keys after 24 hours. Only `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` requests support idempotency.
